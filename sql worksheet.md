Absolutely! The `LIKE` clause in SQL is used **to search for a specified pattern in a column**‚Äîand the `%` symbol is a **wildcard** that represents **zero or more characters**.

---

### üß† **Basic Syntax**
```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name LIKE 'pattern';
```

---

### üî£ **Wildcard: `%`**
- `%` matches **any number of characters**, including **zero characters**.

---

### ‚úÖ **Examples with `LIKE` and `%`**

#### 1. Starts With
```sql
SELECT * FROM batches WHERE name LIKE 'jedi%';
```
‚úîÔ∏è This matches any name that **starts with "jedi"**, like:
- `jedi`
- `jedimaster`
- `jedicouncil`
- `jediskill`

#### 2. Ends With
```sql
SELECT * FROM batches WHERE name LIKE '%academy';
```
‚úîÔ∏è This matches any name that **ends with "academy"**, like:
- `jediacademy`
- `crimeacademy`
- `darkacademy`

#### 3. Contains
```sql
SELECT * FROM batches WHERE name LIKE '%crime%';
```
‚úîÔ∏è This matches any name that **contains "crime"** anywhere:
- `crimeacademy`
- `darkcrimeunit`
- `supercrimefighters`

### üîç More Patterns

| Pattern           | Meaning                                      |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `'abc%'`          | Starts with "abc"                            |
| `'%abc'`          | Ends with "abc"                              |
| `'%abc%'`         | Contains "abc" anywhere                      |
| `'a%c'`           | Starts with "a" and ends with "c"            |
| `'____'`          | Exactly 4 characters (`_` = one character)   |
| `'a__%'`          | Starts with "a", then any 2 characters, then anything |
